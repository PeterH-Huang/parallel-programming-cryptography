# parallel-programming-cryptography
C++ implementation of a client-server application where two machines will exchange an encrypted file. As shown in figure below, a third machine (machine 2) will intercept the file and
try all possible private keys to decrypt the file using the power of parallel programming made possible by Intel's oneAPI. 


The goal of this project was to practice a real world application of parallel programming (in this case cryptographhy) and to become familiarize with RSA public-key encryption algorithm
